# CPU-Scheduling

Out of the various CPU scheduling algorithms i.e 9 algorithms, I've chosen to focus on six specific ones for this project.

1. First Come, First Served (FCFS): Processes are executed in the order they arrive.
2. Shortest Job First (SJF): The process with the shortest execution time is executed next.
3. Round Robin: Each process gets a small unit of CPU time, and if it doesn't complete in that time, it goes to the end of the queue.
4. Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF): A preemptive version of SJF where the process with the shortest remaining burst time is executed next.
5. Longest Remaining Time First (LRTF): A preemptive version of SJF where the process with the longest remaining burst time is executed next.
6. Priority Scheduling: Processes are executed based on priority, with higher priority processes getting executed first.
