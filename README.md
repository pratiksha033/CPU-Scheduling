# CPU Scheduling

This project implements various CPU scheduling algorithms, helping to understand and analyze their efficiency in different scenarios.

## Implemented Scheduling Algorithms

Out of the various CPU scheduling algorithms, I have implemented six specific ones:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ First Come, First Served (FCFS)
- **Type:** Non-Preemptive  
- **Description:** Processes are executed in the order they arrive.  
- **Pros:** Simple and easy to implement.  
- **Cons:** Can lead to the **convoy effect**, increasing waiting time.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Shortest Job First (SJF)
- **Type:** Non-Preemptive  
- **Description:** The process with the shortest execution time is executed next.  
- **Pros:** Provides optimal average waiting time.  
- **Cons:** May cause **starvation** for longer processes.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Round Robin (RR)
- **Type:** Preemptive  
- **Description:** Each process gets a small unit of CPU time (time quantum), and if it doesn't complete, it goes to the end of the queue.  
- **Pros:** Fair to all processes and reduces response time.  
- **Cons:** Frequent **context switching** increases overhead.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)
- **Type:** Preemptive  
- **Description:** A preemptive version of SJF where the process with the shortest remaining burst time executes next.  
- **Pros:** Reduces waiting time and improves responsiveness.  
- **Cons:** **Frequent preemptions** can cause overhead.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Longest Remaining Time First (LRTF)
- **Type:** Preemptive  
- **Description:** A preemptive version where the process with the longest remaining burst time executes next.  
- **Pros:** Longer processes get CPU time sooner.  
- **Cons:** Can be inefficient if shorter jobs keep arriving.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Priority Scheduling
- **Type:** Preemptive / Non-Preemptive  
- **Description:** Processes are executed based on priority, with higher priority processes running first.  
- **Pros:** Ensures important tasks get executed sooner.  
- **Cons:** May cause **starvation** for lower-priority processes.

## üîπ Features

‚úÖ Takes process details (arrival time, burst time, priority, etc.) as input.  
‚úÖ Computes key scheduling metrics:  
   - **Turnaround Time (TAT)**  
   - **Waiting Time (WT)**  
   - **Response Time (RT)**  
‚úÖ Displays Gantt charts for visual representation of process execution.  
‚úÖ Provides a performance comparison between different scheduling algorithms.

## üìå Example Input
Enter number of processes: 4
Process | Arrival Time | Burst Time | Priority
P1      | 0           | 5          | 2
P2      | 1           | 3          | 1
P3      | 2           | 8          | 3
P4      | 3           | 6          | 2

## üìä Example Output (Gantt Chart for FCFS)
Gantt Chart:
| P1 | P2 | P3 | P4 |
0    5    8    16   22  

Average Waiting Time: 5.5 ms
Average Turnaround Time: 10.5 ms
